for creating object file
	gcc -c -fPIC def.c
for creating dynamic lib
	gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,dynlib.so -o dynlib.so def.o
for linking
	gcc test.c dynlib.so
for path
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`
you are all set now run it using a.out



if you are using math.h and stdlib.h
to link
	gcc test.c /usr/lib/libm.so /usr/lib/lic.so dynlib.so
	or 
	gcc test.c -lm -lc dynlib.so 
	this one is used if you dont know the path
	here in you are requesting the compiler to search it for you
